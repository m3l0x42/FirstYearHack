# FirstYearHack

The following contains our project for FirstYearHack. 

So many people strain their eyes trying staring at screens all day, which seriously impacts our eyesight.


***It doesn't have to be this way.***

Meet FishtankFocus, your digital companion app that help your eyes stay safe. 

FishtankFocus is a desktop application designed to help you maintain your eye health and relax while working. By providing constant reminders and in-app guidance, it ensures you follow the required eye health guidelines.

Moreover, the FishtankFocus has inherited an interactive and engaging reward system that will encourage users to follow our application’s instructions. The user can earn points by accomplishing tasks. They can spend those points to buy new and more expensive fish to make their in-game aquarium diverse and beautiful. There is a catch, though! If you run out of points (i.e., the water leaks out of the tank), ALL YOUR FISH WILL DIE! So you'd better keep an eye on your eye health if you want your fauna to thrive!
